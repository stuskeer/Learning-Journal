### What Makes A Data Driven Culture?

**First Steps**
- Build relationships
- Choose transparency in algorythms
- Celebrate and embrace small wins
- Raise data literacy

### The characteristics of data

**The 5 Vs of Data**  
**Volume** - The amount of data  
**Variety** - The different types and sources  
**Velocity** - The speed which it is generated, collected and processed  
**Veracity** - The reliability and accuracy  
**Value** - The insights and benefits we can get from it  

### Big Data vs Small Data
Big data has a larger volume typically with more variety, streams in faster.  
Small data typically has higher data quality as they are more managable and easier to clean.  
Small data often delivers imediate value through straighforward analysis compared to the advanced anaylitics and predictive modeling of big data.  

### Data Types

**Qualitative** - Anything that cannot be described as a number
  - Binominal - One of two values ie Yes / No, 0 / 1
  - Nominal - Named data ie UK, USA, France or Green, Yellow, Red
  - Ordinal - Has an order ie Small, Medium, Large or Poor, Average, Good
    
**Quantitative** - Anything that can be described as a number
  - Discrete - Data that is usually counted ie chairs in an office or people in a town
  - Continuous - Data that is measured ie weight or height or distance

### Engineering Best Practices ###

**GDPR** The europian regulation governing data privacy and consent  
**ISO27001** The international standard that provides guidelines and best practices for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continuously improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS)

**Data Stewardship**  
- Data quality - Ensuring accuracy and reliability for informed decision-making
- Data governance - Establishing policies for managing data assets throughout their lifecycle  
- Data ethics - Adhering to ethical guidelines for responsible data usage

  Products must be Scalable, Reliable, Secure, Performance Optermised and Documented
